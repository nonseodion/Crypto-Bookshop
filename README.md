## How to Mint
If you have a book for sale and you own the rights to the book you can decide to put it up for sale. To do that you have to mint a book first. When minting a book you'll provide the name of the book, picture of the book and the book itself. They'll all be uploaded to Firebase (presently), and when the upload is done, you are told to mint by signing a mint transaction. This creates an ER721 token representation of your book owned by you address.

## How to Sell
After minting you'll see the wallet in your dashboard. Click on it for more information. You'll be able to List it for sale after entering a price. 

## How to Buy
To buy a token it has to be listed for sale. You'll find tokens listed for sale with their prices in the maket section. To buy one you'll click on it to view properly then select the buy button before signing a transaction. When your transaction gets confirmed, you'll be shown the download button. You must download the book in that page because you won't be able to download it again.

## Others
You can also delete, delist or change the price of your book.
